# Zara Khan- Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Zara! I have a background in the healthcare industry and hold a B.S in Healthcare Management from the University of Texas at Dallas. I have worked 4 years in the healthcare industry before deciding to pursue a certification in Data Analysis and Visualization from the University of Texas at Austin. I do believe I chose the right path when switching over my career plan to data analysis as I am having a lot of fun learning these new languages. I am very much left brained with a  problem-solver personality, logical thinker, and result-driven mindset!

This repository is to showcase all the new skills I have learned in the projects that I have created. Some are from the classwork I had and others I did on the side for fun! 

Skills: Python, Pandas, Numpy, APIs, Javascript, HTML, SQL
